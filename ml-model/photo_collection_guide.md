# Lantern Fly Photo Collection Guide

**Version:** 1.0  
**Created:** 2025-09-12T21:48:05.275065  
**Target:** 500 squashed lantern fly photos

## üéØ Overview

**Goal:** Collect 500 high-quality photos of dead/squashed lantern flies  
**Use Case:** Training a machine learning model to identify lantern flies  
**Classification:** Binary: Lantern Fly vs Non-Lantern Fly  
**Timeline:** 1-2 days of focused collection

## üì∏ Photo Requirements

### Quality Standards
- **Resolution:** Minimum 224x224 pixels (preferably 512x512 or higher)
- **Format:** JPG, PNG, or other common image formats
- **Focus:** Sharp focus on the insect, avoid blurry images
- **Lighting:** Good lighting, avoid shadows or overexposure
- **Composition:** Insect should fill at least 30% of the frame

### Content Requirements
- **Subject:** Dead or squashed spotted lantern flies (Lycorma delicatula)
- **Condition:** Various states of damage (freshly dead to heavily squashed)
- **Background:** Diverse backgrounds (sidewalks, roads, leaves, etc.)
- **Angle:** Multiple angles (top view, side view, close-up)
- **Size:** Include both adult and nymph lantern flies if possible

### What to Avoid
- Live lantern flies
- Other insect species
- Blurry or out-of-focus images
- Images where the insect is too small
- Images with multiple insects (focus on single insects)

## üìç Collection Strategy

### High-Priority Locations
- Sidewalks and walkways
- Parking lots
- Roads and bike paths
- Outdoor seating areas
- Building entrances and exits

### Best Times
- Early morning (7-9 AM)
- Late afternoon (4-6 PM)
- After rain (when insects are more visible)

## üìÅ Data Organization

- `lantern_fly_20241209_143045_parking_lot_002.jpg`
- `lantern_fly_20241209_143108_tree_base_003.jpg`

## üìä Progress Tracking

### Daily Goals
- **Day 1:** 200-250 photos
- **Day 2:** 250-300 photos (total: 500)

### Milestones
- 100 photos: 20% complete
- 250 photos: 50% complete
- 400 photos: 80% complete
- 500 photos: 100% complete

## üîç Quality Control

### Immediate Checks
- Image is in focus
- Insect is clearly visible
- Good lighting and contrast
- Appropriate composition

### Final Validation
- Count total images (target: 500)
- Check for diversity in locations
- Verify quality standards met
- Organize into final dataset

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Considerations

### General Safety
- Be aware of traffic when photographing on roads
- Watch for uneven surfaces and obstacles
- Stay hydrated and take breaks
- Work in pairs if possible for safety

### Campus-Specific
- Follow campus safety guidelines
- Be respectful of campus activities
- Avoid disrupting classes or events
- Stay in public areas

## üì¶ Equipment Checklist

### Essential
- Smartphone or camera
- Fully charged battery
- Extra storage space (at least 2GB)
- Comfortable walking shoes

### Recommended
- Portable charger
- Small notebook for notes
- Water bottle
- Sun protection
